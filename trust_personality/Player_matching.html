        You are Player B, representing a community.
    <p>
        As Player B, each round you receive a tripled investment from Player A.
        You're obliged to return 20% as a gesture of reciprocity for the company's actions.
        Then, decide how many additional points to give back, considering your strategy and the broader implications of the company's actions.
