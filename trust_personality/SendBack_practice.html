        Player A, representing the company, sent you {{ group.additional_sent_amount }}, and you also received a fixed amount of 10 points.
        In total, after tripling the both, you now have {{ tripled_amount }}.
    <p>
        However, 20% of these points will be automatically deducted as reciprocity.
    <p>
        You can choose to return an additional amount between <strong>{{ min_return }} to {{ max_return }}</strong> to Player A.

    <strong>Remember this is just a practice round to familiarize yourself with the game. The points you earn will not count towards your final payoff.</strong>
