      <strong>Welcome to the Trust and Investment Decision-Making Experiment.</strong>
  </p>
      In this study, you will take part in an interactive game that simulates economic exchanges between a company and a community.
      You will be paired with another participant and assigned a role at random: either as a representative of a company (Player A) or as a representative of a community (Player B).
  </p>
      Each of you will make decisions that impact not only your own outcomes but also those of your paired partner.
      These decisions will involve distributing a certain number of tokens, which hold real monetary value and will be converted into dollars at the experiment's conclusion.
      <strong>Your total earnings will consist of a participation fee, plus any additional money accumulated based on your decisions during the game. <em> Higher the points earned higher the end payoff. </em></strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
      <li>The interaction will consist of several rounds, each requiring a decision on how to use your points.
      <li>All decisions are anonymous, and the identities of participants will not be disclosed.
      <li>It is important to consider both short-term gains and long-term strategy throughout the game.
      <li>Roles will be assigned after the instructions.
  </ol>
  <p>
      There are no right or wrong answers, so we encourage you to act as you would naturally in each situation presented to you.
