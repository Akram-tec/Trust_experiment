        Player A, representing the company, sent you {{ adjusted_sent_amount }}, and you also received a fixed amount of 10 points.
        In total, after tripling the both, you now have {{ tripled_amount }}.
    <p>
        However, 20% of these points will be automatically deducted as reciprocity.
